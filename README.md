The framework is designed to minimize usage of SQL code in interactions between MySQL server and PHP scripts and to bind PHP object alterations with DB alterations.

## Why it is gorgeous?

- Database reactive tables models. You change PHP model â€” Database changes automatically.
- Generates PHP classes according to existing tables, helps your IDE with suggestions.
- Keeps connections efficient, uses only one active MySQL connection through whole request.
- Keeps connections to multiple databases organized.
- Automatic prevention of SQL-injections.

## Installation

Just use [composer](https://getcomposer.org).
```bash
composer require alexdremov/daim
```

## Beta: what's ready?

You can use it for keeping your Database connections organized and single.
```php
use DAIM\Core\Connection;
use DAIM\Core\Credentials;
    
$cred = new Credentials();
$cred->setHost(host);
$cred->setUsername(username);
$cred->setDbname(DBname);
$cred->setPassword(password);
$cred->setPort(port);

Connection::setCredentials($cred);
Connection::initConnection();
   
Connection::getConnection(); # returns active MySQL connection (instance of mysqli class);

# To set up a second connection (maybe to the second database),
# you can create additional connection mode:

/**
 * Set up $cred2 as instance of Credentials class for the second connection
 * @var $cred2 Credentials;
 */

Connection::setCredentials($cred2, "secondConnectionName");
Connection::initConnection("secondConnectionName");
    
Connection::query('SELECT * FROM `Persons` WHERE 1', "secondConnectionName");
```

Currently, I am working on Query Builder. Some features are already available:

```php
use DAIM\Core\QueryBuilder;
use DAIM\Syntax\SQLEntities\Conditions;

$qb = new QueryBuilder();
$result = $qb->select()->all()->from()->tableName('Information')->request();

# Or more complicated usage:

$qb->clear(); # clear from previous query.
$result = $qb->select()->
    columns('Persons.LastName', 'Persons.PersonID', 'Information.Tel')->
    from()->tableNames('Information', 'Persons')->
    where()->conditions(
        (new Conditions())->field('Information.PersonID')->equal()->field('Persons.PersonID')
    )->request();

# Generates SQL
# SELECT Persons.LastName, Persons.PersonID, Information.Tel FROM Information, Persons WHERE Information.PersonID = Persons.PersonID
# final ->request() returns instance of QueryResult class.
```

Such limited library usage is due to the beta status of the project.
